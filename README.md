## Understanding Quotex Trading Basics

-   **Binary Options:** Binary options are a type of financial contract
    that gives you the option to buy or sell an asset at a set price and
    time.
-   **Expiry Time:** The expiry time is the time at which the binary
    option contract expires. If you correctly predict the asset\'s price
    movement before the expiry time, you can make a profit.
-   **Call Option:** A call option gives you the right to buy an asset
    at a set price. If you believe the asset\'s price will rise, you can
    buy a call option.
-   **Put Option:** A put option gives you the right to sell an asset at
    a set price. If you believe the asset\'s price will fall, you can
    buy a put option.
